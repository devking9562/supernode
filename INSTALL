INSTALL

This is a modular system assembled using Spring.

Use ivy to resolve dependencies and modify assembly.xml
to comply your needs.

1. Check your ant version with
	ant -version
	It should be above 1.6 (I use 1.8.2)
2. Download ivy from http://ant.apache.org/ivy/download.cgi
3. copy ivy-xxx.jar to a location you later use for ant with the option -lib
4. run
	ant -lib <ivy jar location here> supernode
