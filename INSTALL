INSTALL

1. Check your ant version with
	ant -version
	It should be above 1.6 (I use 1.8.2)
2. Download ivy from http://ant.apache.org/ivy/download.cgi
3. copy ivy-xxx.jar to a location you later use for ant with the option -lib
4. build
	ant -lib <ivy jar location here> demo
5. run
	java -jar dist/demo.jar
	
NOTE: build problems were reported with java 7. I use java 6.
	
The demo will connect to testnet3, download and verify the chain.
	
In case you like the demo you might configure the full server by adapting
config/full/assembly.xml to your environment and build
	ant -lib <ivy jar location here> full
	java -jar dist/full.jar
