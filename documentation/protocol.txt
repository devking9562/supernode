Bitcoin Protocol Specification writeup
(c) Tamas Blummer, 2013 

I started this project to satisfy my intellectual curiousity. Bitcoin protocol was not,
and is not to date, sufficiently documented. Re-implementing it was my way to study it
in depth and validate my assumptions extracted from the original source, forum messages,
wiki pages and from chats with other developers.

This document is a write-up of what I learned about the protocol while implementing 
bitsofproof. I hope this will be useful as a source of its standardization.
