INTRODUCTION

Welcome to bits of proof zrt.'s implementation of the Bitcoin protocol.

This is a modern, modular, enterprise implementation targeted to merchants 
and system integrators.

The Server process handles peer-to-peer communication, protocol validation
and block chain store. The data store can be configured tu use a relational 
database or LevelDB.

The validation engine passes most important unit tests of the Satoshi 
implementation and the block chain integration test cases of BitcoinJ 
that are also used in pull testing of the Satoshi implementation.

This implementation supports colored Bitcoins out-of-the-box enabling uses
of the protocol that go beyond payments in Bitcoin enabled by the original
implementation.

Clients or extensions communicate with the server process through an 
asynchrounous message bus. The bus is provided by a separate broker
process. The messages are in protobuf format hence interoperable with 
modules in other languages. A library is provided to implement wallets
using deterministic and hiararchyical key generation (BIP32) and password
encrypted private key storage (BIP38) as well as convinient account 
manager that enables the assembly of multi wallet or multiple client
environments. 

STATUS

This is beta quality software, it already passed lots of testing and
run months in parallel with the network. Feature set is however still
extending until version 1.0 that is targeted for the Bitcoin 2013
Conference in San Jose.

SUPPORT

bits of proof zrt. offers custom extensions and commercial support 
for this implementation.
