INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the Bits of Proof implementation of the Bitcoin protocol.

This is a modern, modular, enterprise implementation of the Bitcoin protocol targeted to developer of Bitcoin applications and system integrators.

The server process handles peer-to-peer communication, protocol validation and block chain store. The data store can be configured to use a relational database or LevelDB.

The validation engine passes most important unit tests of the Satoshi implementation and the block chain integration test cases of BitcoinJ that are also used in pull testing of the Satoshi implementation.

Clients or extensions communicate with the server process through an asynchrounous message bus. The bus is provided by a separate broker process. The messages are in protobuf format hence interoperable with modules in other languages e.g. python. 

STATUS

The implementation passed lots of testing and runs since January 2013 in parallel with the network. It is community reviewed, see: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=122013.0

BUILD THE SERVER
See build instructions at: http://bitsofproof.com:8082/display/BPD/Build+and+run+the+Server

CLIENTS
Applications can use the Bitcoin network by embedding a very low footprint client library. The Bitcoin private keys, that are able to command Bitcoins, are generated and stored at the client side and never transmitted to the server. See the primary client API documentation here: http://bitsofproof.com:8082/display/BPD/Build+an+Application+using+BOP+Servers

Further layers of API are available to support Mobile and Web applications. See more details here: http://bitsofproof.com:8082/display/BPD/Bits+of+Proof+Documentation+Home 

SUPPORT AND HOSTING
