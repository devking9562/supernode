INTRODUCTION

Welcome to bits of proof zrt.'s implementation of the Bitcoin protocol.

bits of proof is a modern, modular, enterprise implementation of the Bitcoin protocol targeted to merchants and system integrators.

The server process handles peer-to-peer communication, protocol validation and block chain store. The data store can be configured to use a relational database or LevelDB.

The validation engine passes most important unit tests of the Satoshi implementation and the block chain integration test cases of BitcoinJ that are also used in pull testing of the Satoshi implementation.

Clients or extensions communicate with the server process through an asynchrounous message bus. The bus is provided by a separate broker process. The messages are in protobuf format hence interoperable with modules in other languages e.g. python. 

A Java cient API library provides convenient access to the message bus, deterministic and hierarchical key generation (BIP32) and password encrypted private key storage (BIP38) for multi wallet or multiple client environments.

Adapters are available for server trusting mobile clients (BCCAPI) and REST API for web site integration. See example Android application, command line client and primitive block explorer in bop-bccapi, bop-api-example and bop-explorer projects of bits of proof zrt.

STATUS

This is beta quality software, it already passed lots of testing and run months in parallel with the network.
