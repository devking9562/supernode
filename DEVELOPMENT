DEVELOPMENT NOTES

Please respect the code style that is aimed toward modularity and clarity.
This code deals with money where comprehensible code is a must. No room 
for ambiguity, side effects and art. Speed is achived by intelligence.

Should you see me violating the above, please remind me to correct.

It would ease merging if you'd use eclipse with the codestyle.xml imported
under Preferences->Java->Code Style->Formatter, enable auto formatting 
on save using Preferences->Java->Editor->Save Actions and have set up 
Additional actions:
	Convert control statement bodies to block
	Add final modifier to private fields
	Remove unused imports
	Add missing '@Override' annotations
	Add missing '@Override' annotations to implementations of interface methods
	Add missing '@Deprecated' annotations
	Remove unnecessary casts
	Remove trailing white spaces on all lines
	Correct indentation
